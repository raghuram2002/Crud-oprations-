# React CRUD App with Axios, Router, and JSON Server

This project is a React application that demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Axios, React Router, and JSON Server. It serves as a practical guide to managing data and routing in a React application.

## Features

* Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Operations:
Perform CRUD operations seamlessly using Axios to interact with a JSON Server backend.

* React Router Integration:
Navigate between different pages and manage routes efficiently within the app.

* JSON Server:
A lightweight mock backend is set up using JSON Server, making it easy to test API functionality.

## What You'll Learn

* How to set up and configure Axios for API requests.
* How to implement routing with React Router for a better user experience.
* How to use JSON Server as a mock RESTful API for testing and development.
* Best practices for managing and updating state in React applications.
* This project is perfect for those who are learning React and want to understand how to build data-driven applications with routing and API integration.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory for the React app
  ```shell
cd my-vue-app
```
3. Install the required Node modules for the React app
```shell
npm install
```
4. Navigate to the fake_server directory
```shell
cd fake_server
```
5. Install the Node modules for the JSON Server
```shell
npm install
```
7. Start the JSON Server
```shell
npm test
```
7. Return to the main app directory (my-vue-app) and run the React application
```shell
cd my-vue-app
npm run dev
```

Now you can exploer the app in your local server
